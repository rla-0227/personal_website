        <p class="main-paragraph">
          For my project course in Human-Computer Interaction Requirements and Evaluation at the University of California Irvine, my group and and I spent ten weeks collecting
          and analyzing the user’s experience with the SoundCloud website platform. The data gathered will be used to address and solve some of the main problems that the
          users identify and experience. We also pinpointed the heuristics that SoundCloud violated and looking at the main target areas that could be improved on. We created
          a redesign of this platform based on our own evaluation of the website and most importantly, feedback from the user’s experience during this process.
        </p>
        <h4 class="section-title">PROJECT ANALYSIS</h4>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          <strong>Goal: </strong>The goal of this overall project is to perform a UX-focused analysis of the system through methods such as competitive analysis, interviews
          and surveys, remote user testing, and heuristic evaluations to redesign the system and improve its user experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Target Population: </strong> Since the product we are studying is a music streaming service, our target population consists of those that 1) listen to music
          and 2) utilize some form of music streaming service. Additionally, we are interested in music content creators, specifically those that upload their music for
          distribution. Technical knowledge is not as relevant. It can be assumed that anyone that is able to utilize a music streaming service has a basic understanding of
          web browsing and mobile device use to use these services effectively. Factors of age, income, education level, and culture are irrelevant to our study insofar that
          these factors do not prevent individuals from utilizing a music streaming service.

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          The first wireframe fulfills the needs and requirements of students whose major is Informatics with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Upon
          looking at the persona for this assignment, a majority of the students were not exposed to HCI until junior year of college. This is a troubling experience for the
          individuals because they felt behind in class while others regret not switching into the major earlier. For my first wireframe, I created a separate page solely for
          students majoring in Informatics. This page provides the user with a step by step guide if they want to explore more about the major. The first box on my wireframe
          introduces the user to the major and what HCI encompasses. Information about learning material, career prospects, and course description will be clearly defined
          after clicking “Learn more”. Next, if the user is interested in learning more about the major, they can follow onto the next box where they will gain insight about
          the internships, professors, and research opportunities provided by this major. After familiarizing themselves with the major, the final box examines job listings
          and other career paths available. I also provided a student profile section below the page so that the personas can click on the profiles listed, and see what they
          are currently doing after obtaining the degree. This first design will satisfy many needs based on the persona’s request. The current website fails to provide
          specific information about the major and career prospects available. Many students have difficulty finding internships and research opportunities due to the lack of
          information. With this new wireframe, the personas will have a clearer picture of the major from the beginning to the end.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-header">Wireframe 2</h5>
        <div class="flex">
          <img class="main-image" src="./images/uci_ics_wireframe2.jpeg" alt="wireframe 2" />
        </div>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          The second wireframe provides students who are majoring in Informatics to sign up or log in through their UCNetID. Upon logging in, the design provides a dashboard
          satisfying many of the persona’s needs. This page is designed to provide users with many features and tools that are not available on the current website. First, the
          notifications box will report any messages received from career counselors or users whose major is in Informatics. This function will allow users to contact and
          discuss related questions pertaining to the major. Next, many of the selected personas identified a lack of on campus events. This tool will provide information on
          events and opportunities related to HCI or informatics. Also, a list of course recommendations will be shown to the students based on what the persona specializes or
          based on their interests collected from the system. In the front and center of the page lists research opportunities, internships, and jobs favorited by the user.
          This will allow the user to be more involved within the major and gain outside experience related to their field. They can also locate job listings on the site and
          add it to their lists of jobs favorited. On the right hand side of the webpage, I designed a section that lists the student class standing and major, as well as
          their current schedule and future schedule. This will help the persona plan for feature quarters spent at the university. Finally, a section with alumnis will be
          provided if they choose to contact and learn more from past individuals.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-header">Wireframe 3</h5>
        <div class="flex">
          <img class="main-image" src="./images/uci_ics_wireframe3.jpeg" alt="wireframe 3" />
        </div>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          The third wireframe focuses on providing more descriptive information on the specializations within Informatics along with informative course titles and
          descriptions. Within Informatics, the major encompasses three specializations: Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Organizations and Information Technology (OIT), and
          Health Informatics. Many of the personas identified a lack of information regarding these three specializations. The current website only identifies the
          specializations with a broad sentence describing each one. This wireframe will provide a more detailed explanation in each of the specializations within the three
          boxes. Also, a slideshow will be incorporated on this wireframe showing the course recommendations for each specialization. The persona can read through each slide
          and go through each course title and description. This will help them identify the specialization that fits them best. On the right side of the webpage, a list of
          professors in this field of study will be presented. There will be professors corresponding to each specialization. The persona can click and learn more on the
          professor’s research or learn the impact they have upon the field. The navigation bar of the current system is informative so the layout was integrated into my
          wireframe. It is useful for the persona to understand the admission process for this major as well as the undergraduate and graduate study of informatics and human
          computer interaction. In this wireframe, I applied the Gestalt Principle of proximity to group the specializations on the left, the course recommendations in the
          center, and professors in the field to the right. This allows the user to identify the sections into three different groups.
