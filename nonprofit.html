        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Kaur Institute is a nonprofit organization that focuses on disaster management and emergency preparedness training for communities. They mainly use three tools to
          achieve this : training, webinars, workshops. The Kaur Institute has three main areas of focus as well : emergency preparedness, building resilient communities, and
          helping vulnerable populations.
        </p>
        <h4 class="section-title">PROJECT ANALYSIS</h4>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          <strong>Goal: </strong> The Kaur Institute is requesting that we redesign their website for their organization. Our goal is to create the user interface and determe
          the front-facing aspects of the website, as well as designing, creating and implementing the backend. The website is full of many static pages that we must create.
          We must also create a fundraising page where donors can safely donate money to the organization. The organization must have a blog page and be able to post blog
          updates with relative ease - a user with little technical knowledge should be able to add content to the website with relative ease.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Target Population: </strong>The target population consists of anyone who is in search of helping a non-profit organization.
        </p>
        <h4 class="section-title">PROCESS</h4>
        <h5 class="section-header">Requirement Elicitation</h5>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          As a group, we had to figure out some of the requirements that our sponsor wanted for her website. We each created a list of questions that we were going to ask her.
          Some of the questions include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>How much flexibility does our group have in creating your website?</li>
          <li>What information would you like to be highlighted on the website?</li>
          <li>Does the organization have many talks or seminars that they record and would like to put on the website?</li>
          <li>What is the best tool to utilize for communication between us?</li>
          <li>Does the organization itself want to emphasize its programs more, or its mission statement and values?</li>
        </ol>

        <h5 class="section-header">Competitive Analysis</h5>
        <div class="flex">
          <img class="main-image" src="./images/np_competitve_analysis.png" alt="competitive analysis" />
        </div>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          We analyzed three competitors to help guide our requirements and understand our focuses on the site. We chose non profit organizations that were similar enough to
          Kaur Institute to allow for relevant comparisons. We also attempted to choose a variety of sites based on rankings and positions in the market to help us identify
          good and bad practices.
        </p>
        <div class="flex">
          <img class="main-image" src="./images/np_unicef.png" alt="unicef website" />
        </div>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          UNICEF utilized a clean design and white space to help the user easily navigate the home page and find the information they are looking for. The site makes good use
          of a blue, white, and yellow color palette that is easy on the eyes. Each block is separated by their background color which makes it easy to identify where one
          section ends and the next section begins. The site also uses many pictures along with relative links to help the user navigate to different pages on the site without
          needing to use the navigation bar on top. Overall the site is able to present the user with all of their articles and press releases without confusing the user or
          cluttering the site.
        </p>
        <div class="flex">
          <img class="main-image" src="./images/np_doctor_without.png" alt="Doctor without border website" />
        </div>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Doctors without Borders was very similar to the UNICEF website although they focused on giving as much information about the organization on the home page as
          possible. Doctors without Borders gave a lot of detailed information and statistics throughout the home page to help show how they help around the world and where
          their money goes. The site has a lot of good information but it is more difficult to navigate than the UNICEF site because the blocks and text are not clearly
          separated. Each block is a bit close to the next and the background color only changes for some of the page. This site understands its focus on demonstrating how
          they help around the world and what they do to accomplish their goals.
        </p>
        <div class="flex">
          <img class="main-image" src="./images/np_ada.png" alt="ADA website" />
        </div>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          The American Diabetes Association attempts to use their site to build a community of members and provide detailed information on how to live with diabetes. Most of
          the front page focuses on their social media and community while highlighting videos and links to information pages on the site. This site is also the only one out
          of the three that we compared to have a login option for users on the site. Although the site contains useful information and ways to join the community, it
          ultimately uses a cluttered design and a plethora of pages that are hard to navigate through in the site.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-header">Storyboards</h5>
        <p class="main-paragraph">We created storyboards to reveal if the concept will work or not.</p>

        </div>
        <h5 class="section-header">Use Case Diagrams</h5>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          We created use case diagrams to provide the high level view of the system and convey the requirements needed to ensure the website is running successfully.
        </p>
        <div class="flex">
          <img class="main-image" src="./images/np_usecase.png" alt="storyboard for the website" />

          <img class="main-image" id="wireframes" src="./images/np_wireframe.png" alt="storyboard for the website" />
        </div>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          In the "Homepage" layout, we focused on presenting the key aspects of Kaur Institute within linking to help users navigate to the page they want. Most of the site's
          content lies within a container that provides spacing on the sides while the header and footer are both full-width to designate the borders. At the top of the page,
          we start with the organization's mission to give a clear description of Kaur Institute's goals to any new visitors to the site. These design choices address our
          Sponsor's wish to quickly inform users what the organization strives to accomplish and how they plan to meet their goals.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-header">Mockups</h5>
        <div class="flex">
          <img class="main-image" id="mockups" src="./images/np_mockup.png" alt="storyboard for the website" />
        </div>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          In the homepage mockup, we wanted to demonstrate a clean design that is still able to grab the user's attention to critical elements. All of our links are contained
          in photos to grab the user's attention and lead them to new sections of the website. We also make use of the company's blue and orange colors to create a cohesive
          theme that ties the page together. Each section is separated by white space to reduce clutter and maximize readability, and the text is minimal so that we can keep
          the user's attention while we direct them to relevant information.
